I am a PhD candidate in Comparative Politics at Sciences Po with affiliations to CEVIPOF and MaxPo. :fr: 

I obtained my Bachelor’s degree in Political Science from Bilkent University, Ankara, in 2018. Before joining to Sciences Po's PhD programme, I participated in several projects conducted by UNESCO's International Institute for Educational Planning (IIEP<https://mirekoc.ku.edu.tr>), Migration Research Center at Koç University (MIREKOC) and Médialab. I received a Master’s degree from Sciences Po, Paris School of International Affairs, where I wrote my master thesis on the measurement of populism with text classification by using 10 million Facebook posts collected from the FB groups of Yellow Vests supporters. 

My doctoral research project at Sciences Po aims to make contributions to experimental methodology in the studies of political psychology and public opinion. It deals with a series of questions concerning how individual emotions transform political decision making during times of crisis in the context of national crises across France, Turkey, and the United States.
